# Sonny

Sonny is a high level detour callback and direct call framework for C++ class functions.

When doing comprehensive reversing on a large scale with lots of classes and definitions, detours can end up becoming disorganised and messy. Sonny aims to fix a number of personal issues I've had maintaining ReNMS, and to appeal to more modern C++ code styles to avoid undefined behaviours.
